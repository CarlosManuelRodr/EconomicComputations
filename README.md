EconomicComputations
=============

Collection of algorithms used to analyze financial data from stock markets and related instruments. This package implements functionality to calculate various types of returns and test for simmetry.

The resulting analyses and algorithms may be consulted in the file `Applications/Symmetry_measurement_in_time.nb` or a HTML visualization at `Applications/Doc/Symmetry_measurement_in_time.htm`.

The definition of returns may be viewed in the `EconomicComputations.wl` package at the root of the project.

For the symmetry test an additional package is included at `TnSymmetryStatistic` that needs to be manually compiled.

## Algorithms
### Trend Returns
Trend returns are calculated by first obtaining the trend duration, that is, the length in days of each elemental trend, which is obtained by grouping same sign returns.

With the durations, trend returns are calculated as the logarithmic difference of the prices at their start and end points.

### Velocity Trend Returns
TVReturns are calculated as the division between trend return and its corresponding trend duration.

* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) (Versi√≥n 10 or greater)
* A Unix-like enviroment to compile the TnSymmetryStatistic package.
