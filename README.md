EconomicComputations
=============

Collection of algorithms used to analyze financial data from stock markets and related instruments. This package implements functionality to calculate various types of returns and test for simmetry.

The resulting analyses and algorithms may be consulted in the file `Applications/Symmetry_measurement_in_time.nb` or a HTML visualization at `Applications/Doc/Symmetry_measurement_in_time.htm`.

The definition of returns may be viewed in the `EconomicComputations.wl` package at the root of the project.

For the symmetry test an additional package is included at `TnSymmetryStatistic` that needs to be manually compiled.

Requirements
========

* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) (Versi√≥n 10 or greater)
* A Unix-like enviroment to compile the TnSymmetryStatistic package.
